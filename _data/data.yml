    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      During my post-graduate studies, researching particle physics at the University of Liverpool I performed complex data analysis with one of the world's most
      advanced experiments at CERN, Geneva. During this work, I developed a keen interest in data and a deep understanding of statistical and analytical techniques.
      I now work in developing novel Data Science (DS) products with Elastacloud, learning to leverage advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enable us to
      utilise unstructured data sets. I have thoroughly enjoyed the creative and challenging nature of unstructured data, and have excelled with this opportunity
      to learn and develop my skill-set. Both my doctoral research and my time with Elastacloud have been thoroughly interesting, varied and educational experiences,
      that have lead me to become a highly skilled and competent Data Scientist. 

education:
    - degree: PhD in Particle-physics
      university: University of Liverpool
      time: 2017 - 2021
      details: |
        This included a 10 month secondment with the CERN collaboration in Geneva.
          - Bullet point
          - Bullet point
    - degree: MPhys in Physics (1st)
      university: University of Liverpool
      time: 2013 - 2017
experiences:
    - role: Data Scientist
      time: 2021 - Present
      company: Elastacloud, Nottingham
      details: |
        In my work as a Data Scientist at Elastacloud I have helped in the development of one of the company's first ever DS products, delivering the utility of
        cutting edge DS techniques in computer vision, optical character recognition and text analysis to provide clients with the ability to harness their
        previously inaccessible, unstructured data sets.
          - Developed proficiency in working with unstructured data, predominantly using the OpenCV and spaCy APIs.
          - Developed ML based object detection techniques using Faster R-CNN architecture, and hosted remotely using Azure ML.
          - Successfully harnessed cloud based computing solutions with Microsoft's Azure API, to perform complex, data intensive analysis.
          - Developed end-to-end Azure ML pipelines and created a framework to make these accessible for new members of our DS dev team.
          - Worked collaboratively with a focused team to rapidly produce demonstrable results within the DevOps workflow.
    - role: Postgraduate Researcher
      time: 2017 - 2021

        Supervised undergraduate physics students, assisting with technical assignments in a range of subjects.
          - Assisted undergraduates in using various machine learning packages and Python libraries, demonstrating proficiency in each subject
          - Applied strong interpersonal skills to effectively communicate the technologies involved
    - role: Research Assistant Internship
      time: May - Sept 2016
      company: University of Liverpool
      details: |
        Worked in the R&D phase of the Liverpool Laser Cold Atom Interferometry experiment
          - Achieved high quality work optimizing and implementing a vibrational isolation platform used in precision experimentation
    - role: R&D Internship
      time: May - Sept 2015
      company: Cavendish Laboratories, Nottingham
