career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I attained my Doctorate researching particle physics at the University of Liverpool, where I performed complex data analysis at one of the world's leading experiments at CERN, Geneva. I then spent nearly two years developing novel Data Science (DS) products with Elastacloud, helping a range of companies utilise their unstructured sources of data. I am now working at DYWIDAG, leveraging a comprehensive suite of Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques to add value to DYWIDAG's product offering of remote sensor and monitoring equipment. This work enables the efficient and timely monitoring of the health of various key infrastructure assets across countries within Europe, Asia, and the Americas.
