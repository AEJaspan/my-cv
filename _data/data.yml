    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I attained my Doctorate researching particle physics at the University of Liverpool, where I performed complex data analysis with one of the world’s most advanced 
      experiments at CERN, Geneva. I am now developing novel Data Science (DS) products with Elastacloud, leveraging advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enable our 
      clients to utilise unstructured data sets. I have thoroughly enjoyed the creative and challenging nature of unstructured data, and have enjoyed the opportunity to 
      immerse myself in the exciting fields of DS and ML.
